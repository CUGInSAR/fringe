# FRInGE Workflows
------

The process for generating InSAR time-series products with FRInGE can be brokedn down into two phases:

1. Coregistered SLC stack to PS+DS Wrapped Phase time-series
2. Wrapped time-series to deformation time-series


## Phase 1: Coregistered SLC stack to PS+DS Wrapped Phase time-series
